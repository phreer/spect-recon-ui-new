# spect-recon-ui: graphical interface based on Qt5 for SPECT reconstruction

## Requirements
In order to build this software, the following prerequisites should be 
fullfilled:
- a GNU/Linux distribution, such as Debian, Ubuntu or CentOS, should be the
base system for building and running this software, as the `spect-recon` library
is only supported on Linux;
- g++ that supports C++11 standard should be installed too;
- `spect-recon`, the core library implementing the SPECT reconstruction
algorithms should be installed to the system;
- `onnxruntime`, `protobuf` (both the C++ library and the compiler) and `dcmtk`;
should be installed.
- and last, Qt5 should be installed.

## Building
The very first thing is of course to clone this repository or download the code
and unpack it, and change the working directory to the project root directory.

To ensure that the `.pb.cc` file generated by protobuf compiler is consistent to
the library installed on the building system, it is reccomended to generate the
`.pb.cc` file with the installed protobuf compiler using the following command:
```bash
protoc ./recontaskparameter.proto --cpp_out=./
```

Then launch Qt Creator, and open this project, modify the `.pro` file to make
sure that the headers and the libraries of the prerequisites can be found.

If the preceding procedures are completed correctly, this software should
be built and run without error.
